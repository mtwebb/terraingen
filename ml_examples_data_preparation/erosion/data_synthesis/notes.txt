Required Assets
---------------
	non_eroded_terrain.hda - generates an uneroded terrain
	erode_base_terrain.hda - applies erosion to an existing terrain


Optional Assets
---------------
	detailing_eroded_terrain.hda - adds details (eg. additional layers) to eroded terrain. This is not required to synthesize the data.


How to Use
----------
	Open erosion_synthesis.hip and make sure the provided assets are correctly installed (Assets -> Install Asset Library) 

	Navigate to obj/topnet1 and cook the imagemagick node.


Architecture Notes
------------------
	The essential nodes in this example of data synthesis are obj/topnet1 and obj/left_terrain. 
	The additional nodes such as the plant scattering nodes provide visual augmentation, but are not necessary to generate terrain data.

	The TOP network in obj/topnet1 works with obj/left_terrain to generate the data. 
	First, a wedge creates variations of the variable "TERRAIN_OFFSET." This variable is used in obj/left_terrain/non_eroded_terrain to subsequently create variations of uneroded terrain. 
	The ROP Geometry Output pulls on obj/left_terrain/non_eroded/terrain to cook the geometry and export the terrains as bgeo.sc files. 

	Next, two ROP Fetches respectively pull on two Heightfield Output nodes in obj/left_terrain. 
	These fetches each trigger the File Cache node which loads the produced bgeo.sc files from the disk, to ultimately produce heightfield pairs (uneroded and eroded). 

	Lastly, these pairs are partitioned and montaged with an imagemagick node.


Additional Notes
----------------
	Examples of both exr and jpg are presented in /sample_output. Results should be similar to these.

	Change the parameter that uses "TERRAIN_OFFSET" in obj/left_terrain/non_eroded_terrain to experiment with different variations of uneroded terrain.
